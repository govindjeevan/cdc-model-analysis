1. Increasing Error by Week
the new graph type( std dev )
2. MAPE in Predictions
Rainbow bar graph type (ordered)
Per wave and overall
by Model Type (ML, EPI, Hybrid, Ensemble) and overall
Baseline1 -> shift cases by 4week (COVIDhub-baseline => stand out )
Baseline2 -> extrapolation of trend line with
slope of 1 week (current - last wk) chg in cases
3. Model Peak Timing Accuracy Comparison
the new graph type( std dev ) [ explore more options ]
4. Stability Comparison of Models
Strong exlusion criteria ( atleast 3 predictions per wave )
Think on how to visalize ( bin, rank order etc )
5.  Comparison of ensemble and ensemble subtypes (which ensemble produces the most accurate data)
Weighted by historical rank, using all models above baseline
Do last based on comprehension from other visuals
